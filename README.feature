  (Reference: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu7gzjK16oc#t=2m57s>)

  The Emperor's quest for galactic domination has prompted him to open a
  supermarket (Empire Market) with a new more powerful laser checkout system.

  Emperor Randy has instructed Lord (Chad) Vader to ensure that it becomes fully armed and operational.

  Empire Market sell only three products:

  | Product code | Name                     | Price   |
  | 001          | Lavender heart           | £9.25   |
  | 002          | Personalised cufflinks   | £45.00  |
  | 003          | Kids T-shirt             | £19.95  |

  The Emperor wants to ensure the loyalty of his customers
  by offering them 10% off when they spend over £60.

  Clint, the nightshift manager has too many lavendar
  hearts and wants to get encourage customers to buy
  more by reducing their price to £8.50 when their
  are two or more in the basket.

  The laser checkout system can scan items in any
  order, and because the Emperor and Nightshift manager
  change their minds often, it needs to be flexible
  regarding pricing rules.

  Once items are "scanned" they are in the "basket".
  When the basket is "totaled" all "discounts" are applied.
